## Project Overview
This repository contains the scripts and documentation for Taufik's master's thesis titled **"Warming Stories: Proximity Analysis of Indonesian Climate Change Coverage in The Recent Decade."** The study, conducted from 2004 to 2024, explores the social and spatial proximity of climate change narratives through an analysis of five mainstream Indonesian media outlets:
- Detik.com
- Kompas.com
- Jawapos.com
- Tribunnews.com
- CNBCIndonesia.com

## Funding
This project is supported by the Indonesian Education Endowment Fund (LPDP) and the Social Data Science Support Fund 2024.

## File Naming Convention
Files are organized following this naming format: `[Phase Code]_[Utility]_[Entity/Objective]`. 
Examples:
- `DC_Crawler_Detik`: A script used in the Data Collection phase to build a crawler for Detik.
- `DP_Classifier_Relevance`: A Data Preprocessing script for developing a classifier to determine relevance.

## Project Phases
- **Data Collection (DC)**
- **Data Preprocessing (DP)**
- **Data Administration & Visualization (DA)**

## Usage
Please use the code responsibly. Note that some of the crawler scripts may no longer function due to changes in the website structures of the analyzed media outlets.

## Timeline
The project commenced in February 2024 and concluded in June 2024.
